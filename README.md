# react-is-class

A function to check whether a component is a class or a functional component. It can be useful to "squash" a component wrapped with a higher-order component and save a react component instance.

```js
import isClassComponent, { isPureClassComponent } from 'react-is-class';
```

Taken from [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose/) from Andrew Clark.
